          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Originally from Germany, I now live in Barcelona with my family. I have over 25 years of experience in
            software development, engineering management, and leadership. My professional journey began
            with vocational training in software application development and has led me through various roles in
            multiple organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            At <a href="https://www.devex.com">Devex</a>, I've progressed from a Senior Software Engineer to my current
            position as Technical Director.
            Devex is a media platform that connects and informs the global development community, providing critical
            insights and data-driven intelligence to professionals in this sector. My responsibilities span designing
            and architecting complex software systems, leading and growing engineering teams, and driving technical
            strategies. I'm also involved in R&D work, particularly around AI integration into our products and data
            processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Devex, I worked at <a href="https://www.sectornord.de">Sector Nord AG</a>, where I led the
            development of <a href="https://www.sectornord.de/en/snag-view.html">SNAG-View</a> and introduced agile and
            continuous integration processes. SNAG-View is a system monitoring solution based on open-source projects
            like Nagios, OTRS, and NeDi, designed to provide comprehensive oversight and support for IT infrastructure.
            At the time, it was the leading solution in the German-speaking market, with diverse clients like data
            centers, manufacturing plants, regional banks, ports, or city's public transport services. My work involved
            project lead, full-stack development and client-facing onsite support to ensure seamless implementations and
            operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also spent some time as a freelance software developer, working on various projects ranging from simple
            websites to online games. My technical expertise includes various programming languages such as PHP, Ruby,
            Golang, C, Java, or JavaScript. I am deeply familiar with relational databases (Oracle, MySQL, Postgres) and
            NoSQL databases (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB). Additionally, I have extensive experience with cloud
            technologies such as AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes, as well as web servers like Nginx and Apache. I've worked
            with a multitude of tools and systems that support the development and deployment of software systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my technical expertise, I have extensive management experience. Throughout my career, I have
            been actively involved in the hiring process, conducting interviews, and selecting top talent to build and
            grow high-performing teams. I am dedicated to coaching and supporting individuals to help them reach their
            full potential, fostering a collaborative and innovative work environment. My role also involves aligning
            technical strategy with the organization's overall goals, ensuring that our engineering efforts drive
            business success. This holistic approach has enabled me to effectively lead teams, manage projects, and
            contribute to the strategic direction of the companies I've worked with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hold advanced degrees in computer science, specializing in secure IT systems and artificial intelligence,
            having studied at institutions like <a href="https://www.upm.es/">Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid</a> and
            <a href="https://www.hs-hannover.de/">Hochschule Hannover</a>.
            I'm fluent in Spanish, English, and German, which helps me to work effectively in diverse teams and
            environments.
